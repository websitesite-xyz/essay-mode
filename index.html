                        <p>Websitesite is a site made <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/">to archive websites Jisu made since she first learned to write code</a>. It's important for Jisu to make a website a place to revisit. For that aspect, each website either needs to be utilitarian or frequently updated or just beautiful.</p>

                        <p>While coding for the first time, Jisu had a hard time putting things in the center of the screen. So she made a code sample <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/nameinthemiddle/">to put any content centered whenever Jisu needs to</a>. In the center, you will see Jisu’s full name in Korean, but you can replace it with any content you want.</p>

                        <p>As Jisu was learning to make animation with code, her first trial was <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/blinkingfive/">to create a 5-second count down website. But, it did not work out and ended up having number ‘5' blinking for ever</a>. To keep herself proud of her first animation she made, Jisu decided it to keep it as it is and named it.</p>

                        <p>Jisu always finds it difficult to introduce herself. So she made an information center <a href="https://jisu.world/info/overshare">to provide more precise information about Jisu</a>. You can find two versions according to its depth and volume.</p>

                        <p>People’s belongings sometimes represent what kind of person they are. Jisu occasionally shares what’s in her bag <a href="https://jisu.world/">to give clues about her tastes, preferences, habits and more</a>.</p>

                        <p>Jisu also introduces a place she spends most time. She named the place ‘Birdcall’ and made a website <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/birdcall">to invite people to her place</a>. </p>

                        <p>Whenever Jisu is writing, she had that moment when she needs to type 'sp' on Google until Google autocompletes it as 'Special characters'. On the top of the results, there is the purple link that Jisu had been revisiting over and over for years. One day, Jisu wanted <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/specialcharacters">to have a personalized clipboard to copy special characters from</a>. So, she made one for herself. Now, when she types ‘sp' on the browser, it autocompletes as ‘websitesite.xyz/specialcharacters’.</p>

                        <p>Jisu also likes to make others to write. Jisu collects verbs and invites people to read the list of verbs. Then, she asks people to submit a list of things that they want to do in their lives. The verb list is a tool <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/doablelist/">to make people can come up with more detailed activities they wish to do</a>. Jisu thinks every verb is doable, and the doableness is the intrinsic attribute of verbs.</p>

                        <p>One thing in Jisu wants to do in her life is <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/readinglog/insearchoflosttime/">to finish reading <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> by Marcel Proust</a>. It is a novel in seven volumes. Jisu keeps attempting to read but fails in the middle of the first volume. So Jisu made a reading tracker to keep herself up and records the time while reading. Jisu even memorized the first sentence of the first volume.</p>

                        <p>The hardest part in writing probably is to come up with the first sentence. For that reason, Jisu always noticed on the first sentences of books and imagined the hardship of the author. Then she started <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/openinglines/">to make an index of the first sentences of the books Jisu read</a>. It helps Jisu feels empowered by reading the powerful opening lines of her beloved authors at once.</p>

                        <p>Like collecting first sentences written by Jisu’s beloved authors, Jisu also collects and archives beloved references and categorizes into three formats: image, text, and link. This filters are built <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/ref/">to make it easier for Jisu to look up remind her previous resources Jisu had been referring to.</a></p>

                        <p>Besides the websites as a tool of Jisu's creative practices, there are some websites that Jisu made for her loved ones.</p>

                        <p>Jisu feels more comfortable with writing than speaking. Jisu makes a web banner template <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/toyou/"> to say the words like ‘Thank you’, ‘Sorry’, ‘Welcome’, ‘Good bye’, ‘Happy new year’, ‘Happy anniversary’, ‘Happy birthday’ to her closed ones</a>.</p>

                        <p>Jisu also made a special one for her lover <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/34th-in-hamburg/">to celebrate his 34th birthday that they got to spend in Hamburg, Germany on December 5th of 2023</a>.</p>

                        <p>Personal computer is the most private object to Jisu. And Jisu finds it romantic to share one computer between two people. Jisu divided a browser in half <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/dualview/index.html">to make Websitesite navigatable by two people at once</a>.</p>

                        <p>Some sites are for Jisu’s health care. Jisu is a person who doesn’t have a routine in her life. She sleeps, eats, works anytime. Once Jisu wanted to challenge to have a simple routine like having an apple per day. As they say, ‘An apple a day, keeps the doctor away.’. So, Jisu made a calendar <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/applelog/">to check her daily apple consumption</a>. For this, Jisu bought a green apple-shaped apple container to motivate herself.</p>

                        <p>Although Jisu doesn’t seem to have a regularity in her life, there are things that comes to her life repetitively. Like her period, eating favorite food, celebrating somebody’s birthday, watching movies and so on. <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/mostrecentjisu/">To keep track of the repetitive elements that forms Jisu’s life</a>, Jisu made a SNS to share the specific moments. Here you can see each keywords in its own timeline. Through this, Jisu feels certain rhythm and cycle though it might not sync to a universal calendar and time.</p>

                        <p>Jisu always gets frustrated to face the loaded camera roll and device storage. She spends hours deleting duplicated and unneeded photos. But as soon as she gets to her older photos, she finds herself smiling. She likes going through old photos but never makes a time go through them. So Jisu made a photo storage site <a href="https://jisu.world/photo/">to help Jisu organize her photos and reduce stress from unorganized photos</a>.</p>

                        <p>At this point, you might be wondering, ‘What made Jisu learn to code?’. It is a natural reaction and Jisu have gotten questions similar to this for many times. So Jisu made an answering machine <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/whycode/">to save herself from answering this repetitive question.</a></p>

                        <p>Jisu hopes you enjoy reading, visiting Jisu’s websites and hopes you to revisit, finds it utilitarian or just beautiful.</p>
